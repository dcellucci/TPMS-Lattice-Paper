\begin{abstract}
Cellular Solids are a novel form of material design which have enabled the construction of materials with unprecedented stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratios. However, the theory that predicts the behavior of these solids uses kinematic determinacy as a predictor for how these solids scale with decreasing relative density. We introduce a novel class of open-cell lattices derived from a parallel family of generating geometries to the convex polyhedron; the triply periodic minimal surface. We show that two of these lattices, despite displaying mechanism modes of deformation which span the full symmetry of the structure, and therefore kinematic indeterminacy, exhibit structural behavior that should be impossible due to these modes, according to established cellular solids theory. We validate these predictions with experimental testing of one of these geometries.

\subsection*{Subsection}

Example text under a subsection. Bulleted lists may be used where appropriate, e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Third-level section}
 
Topical subheadings are allowed.

\section*{Discussion}

The Discussion should be succinct and must not contain subheadings.
